# Multithreading Lab 4

**Topic:** Start, Sleep, and Stop Methods of Multithreading  
**Objective:** Understanding concurrency by implementing start, sleep, and stop thread functions.

## Description
This project demonstrates Java multithreading by printing the English alphabets (A–Z) using the `Thread` class.  
The program introduces random sleep intervals between characters to simulate concurrent thread behavior.
